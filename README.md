# Linear_Regression
This repo includes a report prepared by RStudio and extended R codes related with the report. Report prepared according to questions based on interpretation of variables and model selection process using stepwise and lasso.
I realized after preparing the report that, after I removing the intercept, the R^2 is misleading. I had to calculate the R^2 manually. But I didnot edit it on purpose.
